    <img id="k" src="kobe.jpg" alt="Nba player kobe bryant wearing Las Angeles Laker jersey" <!--chose jpg image becasue it is higher quality  -->
	<p>I chose this picture of kobe bryant because it is when he was still new to the NBA and he was in his prime
	aswell as this was one of his iconic season of wearing his number 8 before switching to number 24 he also won a championship this year.
	</p>
	 <img src="lebron.jpg" alt="Nba player Lebron James wearing Las Angeles Lakers jersey"><!--chose jpg image becasue it is higher quality and maxmizes space -->
	 <p>I chose this picture of Lebron James because this was his firs season with the Las Angeles Lakers 
	 after being trading from the Cleveland Caveliers the Lakers are also the team i support so this was a big deal and he went on to winning a championship the following year.
